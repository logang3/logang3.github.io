# Now

In addition to my day job, I am currently taking System Test & Evaluation, my fifth of ten classes.  

I am still occasionally writing at [hencefarthing](hencefarthing.blog); Alex and I have a collaboration post in work right now.  

I've gotten a lot more into weight lifting lately, and I'm trying to wrap up a couple house projects before summer ends.  

I'm working on creating a family map of my wife's side of the family. I hope to have it done by the next wedding. I'm setting up this very website. Lately I've been playing a lot of Minecraft with Alex.  

I haven't been doing as much reading as I'd like; I'm waiting for some books to be released this fall.  

The last movie we watched in the [Summer of Marvel](/projects/summer-of-marvel) was Spider-Man: Homecoming.
