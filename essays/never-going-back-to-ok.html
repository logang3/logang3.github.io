<h1 id="nevergoingbacktook">Never going back to ok</h1>

<p><em>by Logan Gee</em><br />

<p>What does &#8220;OK&#8221; mean? I was talking to my great friend<a href="#fn:23919" id="fnref:23919" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> Becca about this recently, and the convensation moved on before we came up with a definition. But Becca did have interesting things to say about how we use “OK” these days. And I think its time that we stop saying “OK” all together.</p>

<p>The way that most people use &#8220;OK&#8221; most of the time<a href="#fn:8726" id="fnref:8726" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> is as part of a ritual greeting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“hello. How are you?”<br />
“I&#8217;m OK, how about you?”<br />
“Oh, I&#8217;m fine”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can all agree that in this case the &#8220;OK&#8221; is useless and the entire exchange merely serves as an acknowledgement of another person. Except, I think there is a strong case that this is actively harmful. To all of us.</p>

<p>We all get ingrained in this response, and it starts to affect the way we think about ourselves and each other. We start to believe that everyone else is “OK”. We start to believe that everything around us is “OK”. We start to believe there is something wrong with us because we don’t feel “OK”.<br />
Maybe I’m wrong about all that. In that best case scenario, we can argue that this ritual is meaningless. But even that leaves us desensitized to the well-being of other people.<br />
Becca helped me see that this is not “OK”, and we need to normalize and accept difficulties. We all need to learn to be comfortable with the fact that we struggle. We need to learn that we can admit we need help sometimes, and we need to learn to help each other. Compassion and caring for others will always be better than looking cool and collected but falling apart on the inside.</p>

<p>So I’m going to my part to fix things. I’m never going back to “OK”.<br />
When someone asks me how I’m doing, I’m going to give an honest answer. When I ask other people how they are doing, I’ll be ready for an honest answer and to be supportive of people who need it.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;ll start now. I’m tired, frustrated with myself, and overly worried about things outside my control. But I feel a lot better and more hopeful after this weekend; I’m happy to have such wonderful people in my life and I’m determined to make the best of the present moment and take ownership of the things I can control.</p>
