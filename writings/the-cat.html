<h1 id="title">The Cat</h1>

<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I slumbered, deep and bleary,<br />
Peaceful dreams of tasteful cookies and fuzzy warming socks—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I snored, Z’s was catching, suddenly there came a scratching,<br />
As of someone gently slapping, slapping at a cardboard box<br />
&#8220;'Tis some reverie,&#8221; I muttered, &#8220;of a caffeinated fox—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a dream, a vision in the nox&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back into my sleep I'm falling, all my mind was stalling  
Soon again I heard a scratching, somewhat louder than before.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Surely,&#8221; said I, &#8220;surely this is a wind that passes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me see what scratches, and if the peace I can restore—<br />
Let my sleep be quickly interrupted, and the calm I will restore—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis the wind and nothing more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I left the bedroom door, I saw him there, on the floor…  
There he sat, the restless Cheeto, with his eyes aglow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his orange and white coat, that impish cat did gloat;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the least did he care, just gazed with eyes like a hawk&#8217;s<br />
And he turned, turned back to face that infernal box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scratched and scratched that stupid box</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angered that I had been awoken by the stillness thusly broken  
I implored the feline &#8220;Come to bed; stop this incessant scratching&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But despite the time on the clocks, he was drawn to the dreaded box;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I left him. But as behind me the door was latching,<br />
I could hear him reach out once more, and resume his scratching.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel my mind detaching…</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Cheeto, never sleeping, still is sitting, still is keeping  
His focus on the box, which he is always scratching;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon&#8217;s that is dreaming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the cardboard keeps returning, even after all the scratching;<br />
And my soul feels the burn, the terror of that scratching&#8230;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more sleep will I be catching! </p>
