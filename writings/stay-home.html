<h1 id="whyyouneedtostayhomeeventhoughitsucks">Why YOU Need to Stay Home Even Though it Sucks</h1>

<p><em>By Logan Gee</em><br />

<p>The Governor of Colorado has issued a stay-at-home order and mandated both social distancing and mask wearing. These things are scary, boring, and frustrating. Especially if you think you&#8217;re not going to get covid-19, or if you think we should just get the spike of deaths over with. But they are important, and you suffering a few weeks or months of loneliness or boredom might help save <em>thousands</em> of lives.<br />
But of course you&#8217;ve heard that. You might even believe it. But it doesn&#8217;t feel real yet. So we&#8217;re going to <em>real</em> real, real quick.</p>

<p>As I write this, it is April 9th. When we woke up this morning, 226 of my fellow Coloradoans didn&#8217;t wake up because of covid-19. Another had 6,000 tested positive, and didn&#8217;t yet know their fate.</p>

<h2 id="letslookatagraph">Lets Look at a Graph</h2>

<p>This is two projected scenarios for how this plays out in Colorado. The bottom axis is time, the vertical axis is number of hospitalizations from the virus.</p>

<p>The green curve shows what happens if we all follow the rules. If we all stay home except for grocery shopping. If none of us visit our loved ones who live in separate houses. If we all wear masks and stay at least 6 feet apart when we are out. This scenario sucks. <em>But</em> everyone who gets sicks gets the care they need, and only some of them die. Only about 4,000 will die, to be specific.<br />
The orange curve shows what happens if we don&#8217;t follow the rules quite so well. If we have people over for dinner. If we go to work when we don&#8217;t need to. If we let our kids play with the neighbors. If we think we won&#8217;t be affected. In this scenario, we run out of hospital beds by May 16th. Doctors have to start choosing who lives and who dies. In this scenario, we get to spend a few months less bored and living our normal lives. Except for the 24,000 Coloradoans who will die. Those 24,000 souls will be lost forever and never get to see the economy and society recover. So that sucks.</p>

<h2 id="aquickaside">A Quick Aside</h2>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself &#8220;Well the disease mostly impacts the old or already sick, so I&#8217;m not <em>too</em> worried. Those people had their chance.&#8221; I have two things to say to that.<br />
One - Don&#8217;t be a dick.<br />
Two - You&#8217;re also wrong. When the hospitals are full, the Reaper becomes indiscriminate. People who might&#8217;ve made a full recovery don&#8217;t get the time, attention, or resources they need. And not just covid patients. If you get in a car accident or fall off a ladder, you will not get a hospital bed and might die. If you are giving birth (like my dear sister), who will having a home birth because no hospital can accommodate you. We return to a world of no epidurals and increased risk during what should be a happy occasion.</p>

<h2 id="letslookatadifferentgraph">Lets Look at a Different Graph</h2>

<p>So we looked at the two projected scenarios for Colorado. What about Jefferson County, where we live?</p>

<figure>
<img src="/images/20200409_jeffco_prediction.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If we live the sad, boring, scared, lonely lives the Governor has asked us to live, hospitals will still get overloaded, by May 8th. It is likely that 1,000 JeffCo residents will die.</p>

<p>If we selfishly try to carry on like normal… things get dark. Hospital beds are full in about 2 weeks. Now we&#8217;re looking at 3,000 JeffCo residents dying.</p>

<h2 id="imsorryifivescaredyou">I&#8217;m Sorry If I&#8217;ve Scared You</h2>

<p>This seems pretty dire, right? Well here&#8217;s the good news.<br />
Studies from across the world show that <em>social distancing works</em>. South Korea, Germany, and — yes— China, have had success. The growth slows. Eventually stops. People stop dying.<br />
This means <strong>you could save lives</strong>. If we make the relatively small sacrifice of <em>staying home</em>, we could save the lives of <em><strong>24,000</strong></em> Coloradoans. You could be a real hero.<br />
Your grandparents, your parents, your children, your cousins, your coworkers, your friends… whether they know it or not, <em>their lives are in your hands</em>. So please listen to Governor Polis. Listen to the CDC. Listen to the WHO. Listen to the experts. Listen to reason.</p>

<p>Stay Home. Seriously.<br />
But if you do have to go out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wear a face covering</li>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet away from people. Which is farther than you think.</li>
<li>Wash your hands, for at least 20 seconds, with soap.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a few months, this will be over. And we can start rebuilding. And we will all be better for it. So can we all please just do what we have to do to make sure we all have a chance to see that day?</p>

<p>Update April 10: I&#8217;m sorry if this made you more anxious or scared. I wrote a (much longer) rumination about the things I feel optimistic about it. Find it at <a href="/writings/optimistic-covid">https://LoganGee.net/writings/optimistic-covid</a></p>
