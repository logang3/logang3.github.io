<hr />

<h2 id="fitnesshealthyeatingchallenge">Fitness/Healthy Eating Challenge</h2>

<p>Work out every day, for 30 days straight.<br />
Avoid carbs, sugars, and processed foods.</p>

<h4 id="details">Details</h4>

<p>Workouts: even if its only 15 or 20 minutes, get a workout in. Its important to not overdue, so still only aim for 3&#8211;5 serious strength workouts per week.<br />
Food: the goal is to eat as much natural fruit, veggies, and meats as possible. Cutting out processed foods while maintaining calorie intake will force you to eat a lot more veggies and fruit.</p>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

workouts are going good. i did have to do a few light ones because i&#8217;ve been so exhausted this week. but i&#8217;ve been getting them all in.<br />
foodâ€¦ forgive me body, for i have sinned. i <em>am</em> eating better than previously, but i still lack in the self control department. but life is about getting back on the horse.</p>

<h2 id="mentalchallenge">Mental Challenge</h2>

<p>Make something every day for 30 days.<br />
Minimize inputs, especially fast burn, low value things.</p>

<h4 id="details">Details</h4>

<p>Make something, even if it only takes 5 minutes. acceptable media for making things includes writing, drawing, cooking/baking (beyond necessary), or making actual, physical, real-world things.<br />
Inputs to be avoided include things like news, social media, online &#8216;communities&#8217;, youtube, etc. Weirdly, I have found myself shying away from music as well, unless it to keep me focused while at work. Some things I have decided will continue to be allowed:</p>

<ul>
<li>podcasts on the drive home (but <strong>no</strong> tech news)</li>
<li><a href="dobyfriday.com">Do By Friday</a> while in the car with Kayla</li>
<li>one episode of a DND podcast (<a href="https://maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">The Adventure Zone</a> or <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/">Total Party Kill</a>) per day</li>
<li>books</li>
<li>movies with family/friends</li>
<li>predetermined, dedicated research onine</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p><em>updated Saturday the 7th</em><br />
Making has been going well. Inputs, not so great. But tomorrow is another day!</p>

<h2 id="financialchallenge">Financial Challenge</h2>

<p>Not so much a challenge, as just being more aware/cautious of what we are spending. Its been on our mind with our interest in FIRE.</p>
