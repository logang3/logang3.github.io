title: The Season of Investment

# [%title] #
I officially recognized this as my theme on the new year 2020, all though it had begun a few months prior.  
I wrote [a post at Hencefarthing](https://hencefarthing.blog/2020/02/09/themes/) about the beginning of it. I plan to write a bit more about various details. I'll keep anything relevant linked here. If it doesn't fit into a full post, I might record it here.  

**PAUSED APRIL 2020 DUE TO COVID-19**

After a couple weeks of mandatory stay at home orders, I realized there was a better fit for this time of life: [The Season of the Monk](/themes/monk).
