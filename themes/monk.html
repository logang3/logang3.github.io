<h1 id="title">The Season of The Monk</h1>

<p><em>Updated April 11, 2020</em></p>

<h2 id="originaljournalentry">Original Journal Entry</h2>

<p><em>Dated April 1, 2020</em>
Life is strange. In a matter of weeks, everything changed. COVID-19 came in like a wrecking ball. I figure my life and goals should adapt as well. But I also shouldn&#8217;t let it be a disaster. I&#8217;m going to try to use quarantine to make both myself and the world a better place. I&#8217;m going to develop new routines, new habits, new systems. Quarantine will be a monastic retreat for me.<br />
The things I&#8217;ve always admired about monks are their focus, their discipline, the lack of distractions, the lack of idleness. So I will try to reflect some of these things in my life.</p>

<p>Maybe I don&#8217;t need to check so many websites, whether blogs or &#8220;news&#8221;. Maybe turning on Downtime is a good idea. Doing more for my fitness is definitely a good idea, as is getting away from the computer and getting outside each day. I should walk more. I should have more quiet contemplation. I should have more learning and focused reading. But who knows what this month will really look like.</p>

<h2 id="analogueanalogs">Analogue Analogs</h2>

<p><em>Update April 11, 2020</em>
I have found renewed energy in the idea of comparing things in my admittedly digital life to their analogue analogs. As such, I&#8217;ve compiled a list and decided I should probably try to use the new digital version in more thoughtful ways, often similar to the older analog versions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blogs ↔ Daily Newspaper: I should probably check once per day, probably during lunch or in the afternoon.</li>
<li>Email ↔ mail: Also fall into the check once per day category. Probably the same time.</li>
<li>Podcasts ↔ Radio: I should have a set time that my shows are on the radio, and that is when I listen. 1 or 2 hours tops. Sort of like we do with The Adventure Zone already.</li>
<li>Drafts/iA Writer ↔ Typewriter: I feel unnecessary anxiety over having two options and over using the paid option. So I need to ruminate on this and choose a path forward.</li>
<li>Notebooks/Binders ↔ GoodNotes: For all<a href="#fn:18777" id="fnref:18777" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> my handwritten/paper-ish needs. Use the same way normal people use notebooks and binders.</li>
<li>Files ↔ Files: Duh. Still working out the differences between Desktop/Documents/Downloads/Archive though.</li>
</ul>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Except for my daily journal and my writing journal. Probably. I could be convinced to use GoodNotes as a writing journal occasionally. And maybe someday I'll be able to go full digital. I just enjoy the physical notebook and pen so much. <a href="#fnref:18777" title="return to body" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
