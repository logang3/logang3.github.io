* I finished _Bird by Bird_ by Anne Lamott, and recommend it to anyone, especially those who like to write. 👍🏼
* I am about ⅓ of the way through _Royal Assassin_ by Robin Hobb after finishing the first book in the series.
* I have been reading short stories from _Once Upon a Time_ volumes 1 & 2 by Matt Gemmell when I need a literary snack.
* I have also been reading an essay per workday from _It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work_.
