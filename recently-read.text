* I recently read my friend [Nadia](https://nadiaafifi.com)'s book _The Sentient_. It was excellent, and I recommend it. You should go buy it.
* I'm currently reading _Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man_ by Emmanuel Acho. You should too.
* I also read one chapter of _Ego is the Enemy_ every day.
