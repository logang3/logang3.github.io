* I am still working through _Bird by Bird_ by Anne Lamott 👍🏼
* I started _Draft No. 4_ by John McPhee, but couldn't stay interested. I will probably give up.
* I am about ⅓ of the way through _Assassin's Apprentice_ by Robin Hobb based on a friends recommendation. It started a bit slow, but I am fully enjoying it now.
