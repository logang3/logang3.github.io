<p><em>updated 2019 September 7th</em></p>

<p>In addition to my day job, I am currently taking System Test &amp; Evaluation, my fifth of ten classes.</p>

<p>Alex and I seem to have slowed down writing at <a href="hencefarthing.blog">hencefarthing</a>. That kind of bums me out and I hope to get it more active again with my <a href="/projects/september-2019">September Challenges</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m still trying to wrap up a couple house projects before summer endsâ€¦</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on creating a family map of my wife&#8217;s side of the family. I hope to have it done by the next wedding.<a href="#fn:15634" id="fnref:15634" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> I&#8217;m setting up this very website.</p>

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of Minecraft with Alex.</p>

<p>I decided to stop waiting for books to be released and started reading several times a day. Current books:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.playingwithfire.co/the-book">Playing with FIRE</a> by Scott Reickens</li>
<li><a href="https://kevinhearne.com/books/hounded/">Hounded</a> by Kevin Hearne</li>
</ul>

<p>The last movie we watched in the <a href="/projects/summer-of-marvel">Summer of Marvel</a> was Black Panther.</p>
