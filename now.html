<p>In addition to my day job, I am currently taking System Test &amp; Evaluation, my fifth of ten classes.</p>

<p>I am still occasionally writing at <a href="hencefarthing.blog">hencefarthing</a>; Alex and I have a collaboration post in work right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten a lot more into weight lifting lately, and I&#8217;m trying to wrap up a couple house projects before summer ends.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on creating a family map of my wife&#8217;s side of the family. I hope to have it done by the next wedding. I&#8217;m setting up this very website. Lately I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of Minecraft with Alex.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t been doing as much reading as I&#8217;d like; I&#8217;m waiting for some books to be released this fall.</p>

<p>The last movie we watched in the <a href="/projects/summer-of-marvel">Summer of Marvel</a> was Thor: Ragnarok.</p>
