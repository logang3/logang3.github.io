<h1 id="now">Now</h1>

<p><em>updated 2020 November 12</em></p>

<p>Day job: situation normal.
Master&#8217;s Degree: break, and then ONE MORE CLASS.</p>

<p><a href="https://hencefarthing.blog">Hencefarthing</a> is seemingly dead again. Who knows if it will come back, Alex and I are both focusing on other things at the moment. For now, I&#8217;ll post everything from here there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m supposedly still setting up this very website, but honestly it may stay in its current state for a long time..</p>

<p>My wife is full time working on her Etsy shop, so check it out <a href="https://etsy.com/shops/sweetlyliveddesign">here</a>. And now also making calligraphy for weddings! Get engaged and then go <a href="https://sweetlylived.com/weddings">check it out</a>!</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m reading is updated <a href="recently-read">here</a>. Most of these are borrowed digitally from the library and read on my Kindle Paperwhite.</p>

<p>Most of my time is currently focused on working out and supporting family. It feels like where I belong.</p>
